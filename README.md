Rio Scale 2.0 Calculator

This is a simple collection of Python scripts to implement a new Rio Scale for categorising signals from Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) surveys.

There are no dependencies other than standard Python modules (this was written and tested in Python 2.7)

Simply run

`python rio2calculator.py`

And answer the prompts in the command line

This is still evolving, suggestions welcome!
